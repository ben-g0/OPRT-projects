We can use this file to decide on a project. I'd reccomend starting with a smaller project, or with one that's almost completed.

Please write any discontinued projects you know of that might be suitable in the list below.

SUGGESTED PROJECTS:
1. Dodge: authored by princetonlion, mstly finished but not too much effort was put into it. Very simple TI 83+ BASIC program. Found here:http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/460/46000.html
notes: Might be too simple. T.Wang doesn't have to be notified as I (princetonlion) doesn't have easy contact with him now because I moved.
