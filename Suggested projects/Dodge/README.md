None
This game might be updated in the future so please send all questions, comments, concerns, bugs, and feature requests to princetonlion.tibd@gmail.com

Special Thanks:
Me (Princetonlion.tibd) for coming up with the idea of making this game
T.Wang for fixing most of the bugs and deleting lines of vital code on accident
T.I. for the calc
Everyone on Cemetech for the support and suggestions

This game is stable, but some features and optimizations are missing, and there is xlib for no reason.
