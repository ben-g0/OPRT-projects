PLAY DODGE


Ungroup DODGE TI-83 Plus.8xg if it doesnâ€™t do it automatically like my calc


List DODGE are the scores
MOVEPI is the movement subprogram
DODGEV1 is the main game
Gameplay: 
Note: This is important, but you can figure it out yourself


[<] and [>] : move the pi symbol left and right. 


Do not get hit by the falling *. 


And yes, I do know this game sucks and has about 300 versions online.
